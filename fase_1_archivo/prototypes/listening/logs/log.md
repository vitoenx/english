**Diagnosis**: 65% AI, WER: 36.8%, CEFR Level [A2]

**Challenges Analysis**:

- **Chunks**:
  - “Hello and welcome to six minutes english and I'm Neil and I'm Catherine”  
    ⟶ Intended: “Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil. And I'm Catherine.”  
  - “The worlds bigges producer of coffe is brazil brazil yes yes but that not the question”  
    ⟶ Intended: “The world's biggest producer of coffee is... Brazil! Brazil! Yes, yes, but that's not the question.”
  - “You take a cup of coffee have a name. Usually 6 cups.”  
    ⟶ Intended: “OK, you've had quite a lot of coffee today, haven't you? / Just the usual six cups.”

- **Vocabulary**:
  - “ove the coffe” ⟶ “love the coffee”
  - “paided” ⟶ (intended “paved”? but was not in context)
  - “disapointing im living hope but another cup” ⟶ “it’s always a bit disappointing. I live in hope, another cup...”
  - “latel” ⟶ “vital”
  - “trains anticipation” ⟶ “mouth begins to water in anticipation”
  - “lit” and “holding” ⟶ intended “lid” and “hole”

- **Intonation**:
  - Flat delivery of expressions like “wake up and smell the coffee”, “absolutely vital”, and “physiological response” lost their emphatic or idiomatic character.
  - The humorous tone in “every hour!” and “I live in hope” is flattened, reducing the nuance and dynamic of the conversation.

- **Fast-Speech Similar-Sounding Words**:
  - “what’s the best think” ⟶ “what’s the best thing”
  - “smell does it / im disapointing im living hope” ⟶ “smells, does it? / It's always a bit disappointing...”
  - “holding” vs. “hole in it”
  - “Columbia” ⟶ should be “Colombia” (a common confusion, but relevant here)
