Nombre del ejercicio: TranscripciÃ³n Activa de InmersiÃ³n en InglÃ©s
DescripciÃ³n: Este ejercicio consiste en escuchar un video o podcast en inglÃ©s sin subtÃ­tulos, transcribir lo que entiendas en tiempo real (o pausando si es necesario), y usar marcadores (como asteriscos o guiones) para seÃ±alar palabras o frases que no captes. Luego, comparas tu transcripciÃ³n con la transcripciÃ³n oficial (o una generada por herramientas como YouTube o NoteGPT) para identificar errores, analizar dificultades y mejorar tus habilidades de escucha. El objetivo es entrenar el oÃ­do para reconocer el habla nativa, incluyendo vocabulario, acentos, velocidad e informalidades, mientras desarrollas confianza en contextos reales.
