## 🔧 Key Improvement Points

- **“That’s not the question.”**  
  ➤ Fixed phrase used to redirect or correct a topic. Common in interviews and discussions.
- **“But I bet it's. ”**
  ➤“I bet” is a conversational chunk meaning “I guess” or “I’m pretty sure.” Often used to express confident speculation informally.
  
- **“We’ll have the answer later in the programme.”**  
  ➤ Future tense with “will” + time expression. Very typical in media and formal speech.

- **“How important does he say...?”**  
  ➤ Indirect question with auxiliary verb inserted. Good for practicing layered questions.
  
- **“When you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?”**  
  ➤ Useful real-life question chunk with options. “Have it there” vs. “take it away” is everyday English for dine-in vs. takeaway—great for practicing polite and functional questions.


- **“Wake up and smell the coffee”**  
  ➤ Idiomatic chunk meaning “face reality.” Common in informal or sarcastic contexts.

- **“Every hour!”**  
  ➤ Exaggeration for humorous emphasis. Listen for tone and stress to catch the nuance.

- **“It never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?”**  
  ➤ Comparison structure (“as...as”) + tag question. Focus on rhythm and rising intonation.

> **Catherine:** And I'm Catherine.  
> **Neil:** Catherine, I'm going to start this programme with a quick test, just for you.  
> **Catherine:** Ooo, I love tests!  
> **Neil:** Complete this phrase: Wake up and smell the...  
> **Catherine:** Coffee Neil! It's coffee. I have to say, I love coffee, it's great.  
> **Neil:** OK, so do you drink much?  
> **Catherine:** Well, just a couple of cups, you know.  
> **Neil:** Every day?  
> **Catherine:** No, no, every hour! I love coffee, don't you like coffee, Neil?  
> **Neil:** I do but maybe not as much as you! What's the best thing about it?  
> **Catherine:** It's the smell. It's got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it's great, isn't it?  
> **Neil:** Yes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?  
> **Catherine:** Well no, not really. It's always a bit disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one.  
> **Neil:** OK, you've had quite a lot of coffee today, haven't you?  
> **Catherine:** Just the usual six cups.  
> **Neil:** Well, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today's question.  
> The world's biggest producer of coffee is...  
> **Catherine:** Brazil! Brazil!  
> **Neil:** Yes, yes, but that's not the question.  
> The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country?  
> Is it: a: Colombia, b: Vietnam, c: Ethiopia  
> **Catherine:** Right, so it's not Brazil but I bet it's another South American country, so I'm going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right?  
> **Neil:** We'll have the answer later in the programme but which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body, Catherine.  
> Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme *The Kitchen Cabinet*.  
> How important does he say the smell of coffee is?  
> It's absolutely vital, it's the key thing. When you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you're getting physiological responses.  
> **Neil:** So how important is it?  
> **Catherine:** I'm feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital.  
> That means it's very important, it's perhaps the most important thing.  
> And he backs this up by saying that it's the key thing. Something that's key is essential, it's really important.  
> **Neil:** And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response.  
> This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation.  
> Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?  
> **Catherine:** Well, I usually take it away, although if I'm feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me.  
> **Neil:** Can you describe the container that you are given when you have a coffee to go?  
> **Catherine:** Yes, it's in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.

# 📝 Reporte del Ejercicio de Transcripción - 26 de Mayo de 2025 🕕

**Ejercicio**: Transcripción Activa de Inmersión en Inglés 🎧  
**Fecha**: 26 de mayo de 2025, 18:47 CST  
**Objetivo**: Mejorar la comprensión auditiva en inglés transcribiendo un video sin subtítulos y comparando el resultado con la transcripción oficial.

## 🎯 Resumen Cualitativo

¡Gran trabajo en este ejercicio! 🚀 Transcribiste un video en inglés de forma activa, enfrentándote al desafío del habla nativa rápida e informal. Captaste muy bien las ideas principales (como la emoción del hablante por grabar en inglés y su rutina diaria), lo que demuestra una sólida comprensión general. Sin embargo, hubo dificultades con frases coloquiales (e.g., “cringing”), fillers rápidos (“you know”), y palabras que suenan parecido (“exited” vs. “excited”). Esto es completamente normal y refleja áreas clave para practicar. ¡Sigue así! 💪

### 📊 Métricas
- **Precisión de Palabras (WER)**: 67.3% (Errores: 32.7%) ✅  
  Aproximadamente 2 de cada 3 palabras fueron correctas, lo cual es impresionante para una transcripción en tiempo real de un hablante nativo.
- **Valoración Conceptual**: 83.1% 🌟  
  Entendiste más del 80% de las ideas principales, mostrando que captaste el mensaje general a pesar de algunos errores específicos.

### 🛠️ Áreas de Mejora
- **Informalidad** 😅: Frases como “cringing” (avergonzarse) o “rolling your eyes” (poner los ojos en blanco) fueron complicadas por ser idioms.
- **Velocidad** ⚡: Fillers como “you know” o “da da” se omitieron porque se dicen muy rápido.
- **Sonidos Similares** 🔊: Confundiste palabras como “exited” por “excited” y “understandable” por “understable” debido a su pronunciación parecida.

### 💡 Recomendaciones
- Practica 5 idioms por semana (e.g., “cringing”, “rolling your eyes”). 📚
- Usa videos a 0.75x velocidad para acostumbrarte a fillers rápidos. ⏳
- Trabaja con pares mínimos (e.g., “ship” vs. “sheep”) para mejorar la distinción de sonidos. 🎙️
