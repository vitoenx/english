# 📝 Reporte del Ejercicio de Transcripción - 26 de Mayo de 2025 🕕

**Ejercicio**: Transcripción Activa de Inmersión en Inglés 🎧  
**Fecha**: 26 de mayo de 2025, 18:47 CST  
**Objetivo**: Mejorar la comprensión auditiva en inglés transcribiendo un video sin subtítulos y comparando el resultado con la transcripción oficial.

## 🎯 Resumen Cualitativo

¡Gran trabajo en este ejercicio! 🚀 Transcribiste un video en inglés de forma activa, enfrentándote al desafío del habla nativa rápida e informal. Captaste muy bien las ideas principales (como la emoción del hablante por grabar en inglés y su rutina diaria), lo que demuestra una sólida comprensión general. Sin embargo, hubo dificultades con frases coloquiales (e.g., “cringing”), fillers rápidos (“you know”), y palabras que suenan parecido (“exited” vs. “excited”). Esto es completamente normal y refleja áreas clave para practicar. ¡Sigue así! 💪

### 📊 Métricas
- **Precisión de Palabras (WER)**: 67.3% (Errores: 32.7%) ✅  
  Aproximadamente 2 de cada 3 palabras fueron correctas, lo cual es impresionante para una transcripción en tiempo real de un hablante nativo.
- **Valoración Conceptual**: 83.1% 🌟  
  Entendiste más del 80% de las ideas principales, mostrando que captaste el mensaje general a pesar de algunos errores específicos.

### 🛠️ Áreas de Mejora
- **Informalidad** 😅: Frases como “cringing” (avergonzarse) o “rolling your eyes” (poner los ojos en blanco) fueron complicadas por ser idioms.
- **Velocidad** ⚡: Fillers como “you know” o “da da” se omitieron porque se dicen muy rápido.
- **Sonidos Similares** 🔊: Confundiste palabras como “exited” por “excited” y “understandable” por “understable” debido a su pronunciación parecida.

### 💡 Recomendaciones
- Practica 5 idioms por semana (e.g., “cringing”, “rolling your eyes”). 📚
- Usa videos a 0.75x velocidad para acostumbrarte a fillers rápidos. ⏳
- Trabaja con pares mínimos (e.g., “ship” vs. “sheep”) para mejorar la distinción de sonidos. 🎙️
